#City Hall/ Movement of the Statue
 
##Background
Dick Dowling was celebrated as a great hero by Houston immediately following the war and his death short after. The statue made in his honor, unveiled in 1905, is Houstonâ€™s oldest piece of public art, and the statue was at first located in the prominent position in front of City Hall. However, in 1939 the statue was moved to Sam Houston Park because City Hall was moved. It was then placed in storage in 1957 before being tucked away in a somewhat obscure corner of Hermann Park the next year, where it still stands today.
What does the movement of the statue, from City Hall to Sam Houston Park to storage to a remote corner of Hermann Park, indicate about how the memory of Dowling has changed?
