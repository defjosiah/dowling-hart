#Jefferson Davis praises Dowling in speech

##Dowling as Confederate war hero
Jefferson Davis[^1] was still singing Dowling's praises in a famous **1882** speech. Houston also remembered Dowling. In **1892**, the city renamed the streets surrounding Emancipation Park (a central location for Houstonâ€™s African-American community) to Dowling and Tuam (after Tuam, Ireland, where Dowling was born).

[^1]: Jefferson Davis: The only president of the Confederacy. He was Secretary of War, a senator, and a congressman before the formation of the Confederacy.
