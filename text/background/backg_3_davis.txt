#Jefferson Davis praises Dowling in speech

##Background
Jefferson Davis was still singing Dowling's praises in a famous **1882** speech. Houston also remembered Dowling. In **1892**, the city renamed the streets surrounding Emancipation Park (a central location for Houstonâ€™s African-American community) to Dowling and Tuam (after Tuam, Ireland, where Dowling was born).
