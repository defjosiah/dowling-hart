#Dick Dowling statue is unveiled

##Background
The statue made in Dowling’s honor, unveiled on St. Patrick's Day in **1905**, is Houston’s oldest piece of public art today. Houston held a massive parade with many significant political figures in attendance. At first, the statue was located in an important position in front of City Hall. However, in **1939**, the statue moved to Sam Houston Park because City Hall changed locations, and interest in Dowling decreased in Houston. After being placed in storage in **1957**, the statue was tucked away in an unimportant corner of Hermann Park in **1958**, where it still stands today.
