#Dick Dowling's statue is unveiled

##Former Confederates and Irishmen remember Dowling in Houston
The statue made in Dowling’s honor, unveiled on St. Patrick's Day in **1905**, is Houston’s oldest piece of public art today. Houston held a massive parade with many significant political figures in attendance. Though the date of the dedication being on St. Patrick’s Day, along with the Houstonian Irishmen in attendance, shows that Dowling was remembered partly for his Irish heritage, there can be no doubt that the reason the city wanted to celebrate him so much was because of his wartime triumphs. At first, the statue was located in an important position in front of city hall, proving how important the Confederacy was to Houston. However, in **1939**, the statue moved to Sam Houston Park because city hall changed locations, and interest in Dowling decreased in Houston. After being placed in storage in **1957**, the statue was tucked away in an unimportant corner of Hermann Park in **1958**, where it still stands today.
