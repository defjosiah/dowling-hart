#Richard "Dick" Dowling is born

##Background
Richard "Dick" W. Dowling was born in Tuam, Ireland, in **1837**. He immigrated with his family to the United States in **1846** because of a potato famine in Ireland. They settled in New Orleans, but Dowling moved to Houston in **1857**. He started his first bar less than a year after arriving, and, among other business ventures, helped organize Houstonâ€™s first gas and streetcar companies. Though young and new to town, Dowling had already made a name for himself in Houston by the start of the Civil War.
