##Dowling is still controversial

Dowling’s legacy has shifted dramatically since the years following the Civil War. In fact, the way he is remembered has changed in a pattern similar to how memory of the Civil War as a whole has changed over time. Immediately following the Civil War, people in the South openly celebrated Dowling’s victory at Sabine Pass. Over time, however, pride in the Confederacy diminished, and people began to forget about Dowling. Eventually those that did remember and celebrate him became embarrassed about his participation in the Civil War. This was especially true after the civil rights movement. Out of respect for the objectionable nature of the Confederacy’s protection of slavery, Dowling’s admirers only praise his Irish heritage and business successes.
Despite this trend, Dowling is remembered differently by other Houstonians and is still controversial. In fact, he sometimes enjoys the media spotlight even today, such as in a Houston Chronicle article written as recently as June 13, 2014. This article focused largely on the former slaves who fought for their freedom with the Union in the Battle of Sabine Pass, indicating that today most public discussion of Dowling is moderated by concerns about slavery.
