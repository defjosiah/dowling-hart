#Battle of Sabine Pass

#Background
The Battle of Sabine Pass was fought September 8, 1863, at the border of Louisiana and Texas. In this battle, Confederate soldiers Dick Dowling and his Davis Guard prevented the Union army from entering Texas until much later in the war. Following the battle, Dowling and his troops were acclaimed throughout the Confederacy, receiving Confederate medals of valor as well as high praise from Jefferson Davis. While acknowledging that Dowling and the Davis guard achieved an impressive victory over the Union forces, we must also remember that the cause they fought for was that of the Confederacy.
