#Dick Dowling Middle School opens

##Controversy begins over Dowling's memory during the civil rights movement
In the middle of the civil rights movement[^civil rights movement] and the fight to desegregate Houston schools, Dick Dowling Middle School received its name in **1968**. Many Houstonians have thought that naming this school after Dowling was intended as a public offense against African-American Houstonians. The names of Dowling Street and Tuam Street have also been considered offensive toward Houstonâ€™s African-American community.

[^civil rights movement]: civil rights movement: The American civil rights movement was a social movement from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s in which African-Americans protested and worked to get equal rights.
