#Dick Dowling Middle School opens

##Background
In the middle of the civil rights movement and the fight to desegregate Houston schools, Dick Dowling Middle School received its name in **Fall 1968**. Many Houstonians have thought that naming this school after Dowling was intended as a public offense against African-American Houstonians. The names of Dowling Street and Tuam Street have also been considered offensive toward Houstonâ€™s African-American community.
