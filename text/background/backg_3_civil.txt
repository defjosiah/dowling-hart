#Civil Rights
 
#Background
In the years following emancipation and during the Civil Rights movement, Houston chose to name several institutions and objects in Dick Dowling’s honor, as well as for other prominent Confederate figures. The streets surrounding Emancipation Park, a central location for Houston’s African American community, were renamed to Dowling and Tuam (after Tuam, Ireland, where Dowling was born) in 1892. Dick Dowling Middle School received its name in 1968. Many have perceived these efforts to celebrate Dowling as sleights against African American Houstonians. Whether the offenses to African Americans were intentional or not, was it wrong of Houston regardless to celebrate Dowling in such a manner without careful consideration of how his memory might offend some citizens?
