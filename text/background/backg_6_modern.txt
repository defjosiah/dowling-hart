#Dowling's statue is rededicated

##Dowling's Irish heritage is celebrated with silence about Confederate service
Despite any controversy surrounding Dowling, on **March 16, 1997**, the statue was rededicated, but the focus of the ceremony was placed on Dowling's Irish heritage. The key speaker, Dr. Tony Claffey from Dowling's birthplace in Ireland, barely mentioned the Confederacy as he praised Dowling as an Irish immigrant to the United States. Dick Dowlingâ€™s status had changed drastically from the years immediately following the Civil War. By 1997, most people considered it impossible to celebrate Dowling publicly for his participation in the Confederacy, instead focusing on his Irish heritage and business successes. Still, many Houstonians did not want the statue to be rededicated but would have rather taken it down because Dowling will always represent the oppression of slavery in their eyes.
