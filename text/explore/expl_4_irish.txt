#Irish Heritage

##Dr. Claffey's Speech

**Text**

Today we are assembled beneath the statue of a hero [Dowling] with the shamrock at his feet and a roll of honour bearing names one would expect to find on a patriots’ memorial in Ireland. This is a good place to remember St Patrick not just for the geographical facts of his life but to recall that Patrick was Irish by adoption rather than birth; that he started in Ireland on the lowest rung of the ladder, in fact as a slave, that eventually by the quality of his life he won the hearts of his contemporaries*; that he had a dream - a dream about the brotherhood of man. In short Patrick does not belong to the Ireland of the past but to the world-wide Irish diaspora* of the present. And his spirit is reflected in this memorial, for Dick Dowling is one of Patrick’s and Ireland’s illustrious* sons of whom Houston and Tuam* are justly proud.
