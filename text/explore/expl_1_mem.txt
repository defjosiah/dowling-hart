#Memory after the War

##Jefferson Davisâ€™s 1882 speech in New Orleans.

**Text**
There are few in this audience who, if I asked them, could tell me who
commanded at Sabine Pass. And yet, that battle of Sabine Pass was more
remarkable than the battle of Thermopylae*, and when it has orators* and poets
to celebrate it, will be so esteemed* by mankind.
The disparity* of numbers was greater, the inequality of arms was greater.
When an iron-clad* fleet came to pass the Sabine so as to invade the interior
of Texas, an Irish Lieutenant, with forty-two men behind a little mud fort,
having only field guns* for its armament*, held them in check*. When he asked
for instructions he was told he had better retire*. But this gallant* man
said: "We will never retire!""
