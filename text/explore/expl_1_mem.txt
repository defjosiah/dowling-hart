#Speech about the battle

**Text**

There are few in this audience who, if I asked them, could tell me who
commanded at Sabine Pass. And yet, that battle of Sabine Pass was more
remarkable than the battle of Thermopylae[^thermopylae], and when it has
orators[^orators] and poets to celebrate it, will be so esteemed[^esteemed] by
mankind.  The disparity[^disparity] of numbers was greater, the inequality of
arms was greater.  When an iron-clad[^iron-clad] fleet came to pass the Sabine
so as to invade the interior of Texas, an Irish Lieutenant, with forty-two men
behind a little mud fort, having only field guns[^guns] for its
armament,[^armament] held them in check.[^check] When he asked for instructions
he was told he had better retire.[^retire] But this gallant[^gallant] man said:
"We will never retire!"
