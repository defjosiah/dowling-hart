#Memory after the War

##Jefferson Davis speech in New Orleans.

**Text**

There are few in this audience who, if I asked them, could tell me who
commanded at Sabine Pass. And yet, that battle of Sabine Pass was more
remarkable than the battle of Thermopylae[^1], and when it has orators[^2] and
poets to celebrate it, will be so esteemed[^3] by mankind.  The disparity[^4]
of numbers was greater, the inequality of arms was greater.  When an
iron-clad[^5] fleet came to pass the Sabine so as to invade the interior of
Texas, an Irish Lieutenant, with forty-two men behind a little mud fort, having
only field guns[^6] for its armament[^7], held them in check[^8]. When he asked
for instructions he was told he had better retire[^9]. But this gallant[^10]
man said: "We will never retire!""
