**Text**
The cavalcade* that passed in review down the streets of Houston this 
afternoon was gay* with color. Ladies and gentlemen in carriages, uniformed
troops, flags, bright gowns and streamers completed the arrangement.

Promptly at 3:30 o’clock the carriages ordered were drawn up before the Rice
hotel. Governor Lanham, Mayor Jackson, John H. Kirby, Judge Robertson,
Brigadier General Thomas H. Edgar and ex-Governor Lubbock whirled away in
advance and thereafter followed carriages bearing the survivors of the 
battle of Sabine Pass, sponsors, priests of the Catholic church, the
surviving relatives of Dick Dowling, officers of the auxiliary* of the
 Ancient Order of Hibernians* and representatives of Robert E. Lee 
 Chapter, United Daughters of the Confederacy...Grand Marshall O’Leary...
 Otto Sense and William Olschewake, in the rear of the mounted police and 
 sheriffs headed the first division. 

The parade traversed* Caroline to McKinney, McKinney to Main, Main to
Franklin, Franklin to Travis, and Travis to the city hall, where the statue
of Dick Dowling was unveiled.

The line of march was thronged* with people. Main street was alive with
humanity and about the statue the crowd was packed into a compact mass of
people bent upon witnessing the ceremony and listening to the addresses of
the occasion.
