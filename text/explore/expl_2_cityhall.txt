#Newspaper article about celebration

**Text**
“God save Ireland” and “Dixie”[^1] were the strains[^2] that were blended in one grand harmony today.
[...]
Amid deafening cheers[^3] the white canvas[^4] that enwrapped[^5] the marble statue of Lieutenant Richard W. Dowling loosened its folds as the cord tightened . . . The elaborate[^6] program that the committee in charge of the monument unveiling[^7] had prepared was carried out in detail, and in spite of threatening[^8] skies the streets were thronged[^9].

A jam of humanity[^10] surged[^11] about the corner of Preston avenue and Travis streets, where the exercises[^12] occurred and where the splendid[^13] monument stands in the parked grounds with the city hall towering behind it in most effective background.

The speakers' stand was erected just in the rear of the monument. There were seats reserved for 150 members of the local committees and distinguished visitors. The stand was decorated in the chosen colors of the day, yellow, white and green, and above it fluttered the flags of the United States, Ireland and the Stars and Bars[^14]. Towering palms graced the base of the monument. The great body of school children was grouped in the plaza[^15] in front of the city hall.
